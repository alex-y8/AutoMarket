# My Personal Project: AutoMarket

## Project Description

This project will be a **car marketplace** application where users can view and purchase a diverse range of cars. 
Users will have the ability to browse a diverse range of cars on the marketplace,
filter them based on specifications, and view detailed stats for each car.
Users can add cars to their personal garage and view this saved list even when the application is quit and rerun.

This application is designed for car enthusiasts and individuals interested in purchasing and managing their virtual 
car collection. It is especially useful to users who appreciate detailed car specifications, statistics, and the 
experience of browsing and acquiring vehicles in a digital marketplace.

This project is of interest to me because growing up, I have always been interested in cars and their specifications. 
So, I have decided to create a car marketplace application with cars on sale, highlighting the details of each car.
